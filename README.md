# Pedestrian-Simulator
Simulating the movement of pedestrians in a segement of a shopping centre

Description:
Project attempts to simulate the movement of pedestrian agents within an urban environment (segment of a shopping centre). Agents select a destination (shop) at random and plan an efficient path to their destination avoiding enviromental terrain (walls) using the A* path planning algorithm. Interactions between agents and obstacles are governed by a form of Coulomb's Law.


Running Instructions:
This code was written using the NetBeans IDE but can be compiled and run through command line using a JVM. It is necessary to edit files 'PS_Main.java' and 'MATLAB Code_5' to ensure that data is being exported and imported respectively to/from an appropriate directory on the user's local machine.
